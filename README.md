# Tummy-Recipe
Welcome to Tummy Recipe, a mobile application that uses natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to help users find recipes based on ingredients. With Tummy Recipe, you can easily discover delicious meals using the ingredients you already have in your kitchen.

Our NLP technology includes both speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, allowing you to search for recipes using your voice or by typing in the ingredients you have on hand. Our AI-powered technology will search through thousands of recipes to find the perfect match, making it easy for you to find the perfect recipe for any occasion.

In addition to searching for recipes, Tummy Recipe also includes a "Last 10 Clicked" tab that allows you to easily access the recipes you've recently viewed. You can also view detailed recipe instructions and cooking times, as well as see which ingredients you'll need for each recipe.

Tummy Recipe is built using the MVP (Model View Presenter) architecture, which helps to separate the presentation layer from the business logic and data models. This allows for a clean and modular design, making it easy to add new features and functionality to the app.
